This is a mod for [Caves of Qud](https://www.cavesofqud.com/).

The only thing this mod does, is adds the current Parasang to the Zone-name. 
As most Qud-players know: A zone (1 square on the World Map) consists of 9 screens (called Parasang) in a 3x3 grid. 

Zone with 9 parasangs: 

| NW | N | NE |
| -- | - | -- |
| W  | C | E  |
| SW | S | SE |
